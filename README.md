# MyWebsite
This website is a general purpose website to show the world some of my projects and to learn full stack development. 


# completed steps
## setting up a static website in Github using pages 
I followed the following medium post to get a static website https://medium.com/flycode/how-to-deploy-a-static-website-for-free-using-github-pages-8eddc194853b

## custom domain 
I created a custom domain and set up the website so that "thomashaffenreffer.com" is a searchable domain

# roadmap 
## create a flushed out website with multiple pages
I am currently reviewing CSS to build a couple of static pages that visually are coherent 


## self hosting
I intend on setting up a personal server so that I am not reliant on Github to host the website 

## setting up a back end
I would like to be able to directly host a couple of the projects I built using both python and C++ (and future c project) on the website

## setting up a database and integrating it with the website
